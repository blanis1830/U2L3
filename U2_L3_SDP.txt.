1 - self.__turn is a private attribute. This variable stores the token (X or O) of the current turn. Given that it is private, it cannot be edited outside of the class. 
  In what method should self.__turn be updated to reflect the upcoming turn?
 place_token



2 - The tic-tac-toe game board is made up of 9 total cells (3x3 grid). There are different strategies for what info a user should provide to have them select an open cell. 
  Describe how you plan to approach this task.
 Make 3x3 array of something like 
 [[],[],[]]
 [[],[],[]]
 [[],[],[]]
and with a similar moving function from the old final project, I can make it so you can choose which space you want to update.



3 - __check_win() is a private method - it cannot be accessed outside of the class. Where in the class should __check_win() be called? What argument(s) should it accept?
I believe it should be called in is_winner, due to is_winner being able to be called outside the class. Is_winner also returns if x or o won, which needs to actually see 
if it won through check win



4 - The TicTacToe class holds the very basic tools needed to make a functional game. However, there are other resources that need added in your main.py. 
  Come up with at least 2 other functions (aside from main) that you will need to implement in main.py to make the game truly functional. 
  Describe the purpose of these functions and any arguments they take.
Rules, they describe the rules to the players and doesnt take any arguements except self
__computer_turn, the next computer turn, will always be O and the players with always be X



5 - The biggest challenge of programming games like this one is checking all possible win conditions. 
  Summarize/describe your plan of attack - what algorithm do you plan to use to check the possible win conditions?
Im probably going to spam if statements yandere dev code style.
